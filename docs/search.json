    "text": "Introduction\nHospitals generate enormous amounts of data every single day—from patient records and diagnostic tests to clinical research. Yet, much of this data remains unused, sitting in databases instead of driving better decisions and outcomes. During my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Sciences at Queen’s University, I saw this untapped potential firsthand. It was this realization that inspired me to pivot toward data science, a field that has the power to turn raw data into actionable insights. This blog chronicles my journey from a biomedical background to becoming a student of data science, highlighting the challenges, successes, and lessons learned along the way.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Shows the connection between biomedical science and data analysis\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nI’ve always been passionate about science and its ability to improve lives. My undergraduate years focused on understanding human health and disease, and as a research assistant, I worked on projects ranging from surgical outcome studies to examining how nutritional supplements impacted patient recovery. Despite the valuable insights these projects provided, I couldn’t help but notice a gap: vast amounts of patient data were collected but not analyzed in meaningful ways. Questions like “What patterns in preoperative data predict complications?” or “Can we use patient histories to optimize treatments?” went unanswered. These questions fueled my curiosity about data science and its potential to bridge this gap in healthcare.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - Represents the collaborative nature of healthcare, where professionals from diverse backgrounds come together.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovering Data Science\nMy first real encounter with the possibilities of data science came during a research meeting. A dataset containing years of diagnostic information was discussed, but no one in the room had the tools or expertise to analyze it. That was my lightbulb moment: this data held answers to critical questions about patient care, and I wanted to uncover them. Transitioning to data science wasn’t easy. I didn’t have a technical background and felt overwhelmed by the thought of learning programming and statistics from scratch. But my curiosity about the field—and the real-world impact it could have—drove me to take the leap. I enrolled in a Master’s program in Data Science, armed with determination and a willingness to embrace new challenges.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Illustrates the potential of data science in healthcare, highlighting how patient data and innovative tools can be used to drive smarter decisions and better outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges of Starting in Data Science\nThe transition from biomedical sciences to data science was both exciting and intimidating. I had no prior experience with programming languages like Python or R, and concepts like machine learning and data wrangling felt completely foreign. I spent countless hours debugging simple scripts and learning how to manipulate messy datasets. What kept me motivated was my background in research. I treated coding like solving a puzzle, breaking down problems into smaller steps and learning through trial and error. Over time, I became more comfortable with tools like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, and started building confidence in my ability to analyze and visualize data effectively.\n\n\nData Science in Action: Lessons and Insights\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of learning data science has been applying it to real-world healthcare problems. For instance, during a class project, I analyzed patient lab results to build a predictive model for identifying early signs of chronic conditions. By examining trends across thousands of records, I was able to identify markers that could help clinicians flag at-risk patients earlier. Another project involved creating data visualizations for surgical outcomes. Using tools like Altair and Tableau, I developed dashboards that displayed key metrics such as recovery times and complication rates. These visualizations made it easier for healthcare teams to identify trends and prioritize improvements. Through these experiences, I’ve learned that data science isn’t just about algorithms or code—it’s about asking the right questions and communicating findings in a way that drives action. The ability to turn raw data into insights that improve decision-making is what makes this field so impactful.\n\n\nAdvice for Aspiring Data Scientists\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead\nWhen I look back, I’m genuinely amazed by how much I’ve learned and how far I’ve come. Data science has shown me what’s possible when we harness the full potential of hospital data—whether it’s improving diagnoses, streamlining treatments, or driving innovation in healthcare. But this is just the beginning. My goal is to keep exploring the intersection of data science and healthcare, working on projects that make a real difference in people’s lives. Whether it’s finding ways to predict patient outcomes or building tools that help clinicians make better decisions, I’m excited about the possibilities.\nIf you’re thinking about diving into data science, my advice is simple: just start. Learn a programming language, explore a dataset, or tackle a small project. The journey can feel overwhelming at first, but every step forward is worth it. I’d love to hear about your experiences—how do you see data shaping the future of your industry? Let’s connect and share ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost With Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\ncode\n\n\nanalysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 17, 2025\n\n\nHarlow Malloc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome To My Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 14, 2025\n\n\nTristan O’Malley\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
